# Equity-Research-Chatbot

The Equity  Research Chatbot is a user-friendly news research tool designed to facilitate effortless information retrieval from articles related to the stock market and financial domain. Users can input article URLs or upload text files containing URLs to fetch article content. The chatbot then processes the article content using LangChain's UnstructuredURL Loader, divides the document into different chunks, constructs an embedding vector using OpenAI's embeddings, and leverages FAISS, a powerful similarity search library, to enable swift and effective retrieval of relevant information. Additionally, users can interact with the chatbot by inputting queries and receiving answers along with source URLs.

 Note: This is an implementation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation(RAG) techniques that refer to the dataset provided for relevant responses.
